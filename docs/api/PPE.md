# API PPE

This API serves the purpose of validating data requests for the PPE system (*portal de pago electrónico*). Note that this system is supposed to interact asynchronously with TGR (*tesorería general de la república*) for payment confirmation, which will be simulated. Let `SERVER_IP` be a shell variable that holds the local IP address of the API server.
